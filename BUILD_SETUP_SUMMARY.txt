BUILD SETUP ANALYSIS AND FIXES

ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN ORIGINAL CMAKELISTS.TXT:

1. DUPLICATE DECLARATIONS: The original file contained two cmake_minimum_required() 
   and two project() declarations, which is invalid syntax in CMake.

2. INCORRECT TARGET LINKING ORDER: The executable targets were being created 
   and linked before the Magnum subdirectory was processed, causing linking errors 
   because the required targets (Magnum::Application, Magnum::GL, etc.) weren't 
   available yet.

3. MISSING MODULE PATH: The CMAKE_MODULE_PATH wasn't properly configured to 
   locate the Magnum library's FindMagnum.cmake file.

HOW THE ISSUES WERE SOLVED:

1. CLEANED UP STRUCTURE: Removed duplicate declarations and organized the 
   CMakeLists.txt with a logical flow:
   - Set minimum required version and project name once
   - Added corrade subdirectory first
   - Configured magnum with required components
   - Added magnum subdirectory
   - Set up CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to include magnum modules
   - Used find_package to locate required Magnum components
   - Created executables and linked them after all dependencies were available

2. FIXED LINKING ORDER: Ensured that all required libraries and components 
   were available before attempting to link executables to them.

3. PROPER SUBDIRECTORY HANDLING: Used add_subdirectory() for corrade and magnum 
   with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL to build them as part of the project without cluttering 
   the build output.

SPECIFIC CHANGES MADE TO CMAKELISTS.TXT:

1. REMOVED duplicate cmake_minimum_required() and project() declarations
2. ADDED CMAKE_MODULE_PATH assignment to include magnum modules directory
3. MOVED find_package(Magnum REQUIRED ...) after adding magnum subdirectory
4. REORGANIZED executable creation and linking to happen after all dependencies
5. COMMENTED OUT the 'basic' executable since GraphicsTest/dev/basic.cpp was empty
6. ADDED Corrade::Main to target_link_libraries for proper application entry points

RESULT:
The build now completes successfully with TriangleExample executable built properly.
The setup includes all necessary Magnum components (GL, Sdl2Application, Primitives,
MeshTools, Shaders, SceneGraph, Trade) and is ready for graphics programming.
