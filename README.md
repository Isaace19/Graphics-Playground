Gist of this repo is to be the simplest and quickiest 3D graphics environment. 

So by using this project, you have a simple little environment into which you can test out your
own collision detection and resolution implementations without having to also stress out about graphics. 

So goal is that it can be plug and play separate of whatever libraries you may end up using to attempt collision detection 
and other physics engine related things.
